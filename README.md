# Scala API and CLI for ZooKeeper

A collection of Scala artifacts that make working with ZooKeeper enjoyable.

The project page with links to documentation can be found at <https://davidedwards.io/zookeeper/>.

## Projects

* [zookeeper-client](zookeeper-client/) - a functional API layered over the ZooKeeper client
* [zookeeper-cli](zookeeper-cli/) - a much nicer command line program that replaces `zkCli.sh`

See individual subprojects for additional information. Note that `zookeeper-cli` depends on `zookeeper-client`.
