# Scala API and CLI for ZooKeeper
A collection of Scala artifacts that make working with ZooKeeper enjoyable.

The project page with links to documentation can be found at <http://loopfor.com/zookeeper/>.

## Projects
* `zookeeper-client` - a functional API layered over the ZooKeeper client
* `zookeeper-cli` - a much nicer command line program that replaces `zkCli.sh`

See individual subprojects for build instructions. Note that `zookeeper-cli` depends on `zookeeper-client`.
